Republican senator Lindsey Graham said in 2015 [that he has never sent an email.](https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/lindsey-graham-ive-never-sent-email-n319571){:target="blank"}

What exactly is it that makes him believe he's qualified to push legislation for an [internet technology bill?](https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21116788/earn-it-act-section-230-lindsey-graham-draft-bill-encryption){:target="blank"}

## "Think of the children" is not an excuse to attack civil liberties.

> Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) is behind the bill, currently dubbed the Eliminating Abusive and Rampant Neglect of Interactive Technologies (or EARN IT) Act. It would amend Section 230 to make companies liable for state prosecution and civil lawsuits over child abuse and exploitation-related material, unless they follow the committeeâ€™s best practices.

Unfortunately, things arent always as they seem. Under the guise of preventing child exploitation, anyone who attacks this bill automatically would be criticized for opposing a goal to ensure the safety of young people. However, essentially ridding all end-to-end encryption strategies will cause detriment to other aspects of society.

The bill would circumvent the end-to-end encryption practices many large web companies have established, as under the EARN IT Act, a committee could (would) require Facebook and other companies to add a backdoor for law enforcement. 


> What exactly is end to end encryption?

It allows you and I to communicate securely, without the medium we're communicating through or anyone else outside the conversation the ability to alter or read our discussions. 


Also in 2015 was [Trump's display of Graham's phone number during a speech,](https://youtu.be/eFsgLeYafIk){:target="blank"} which Graham responded to by questioning whether he should "get a new iPhone or android phone"; seemingly showing he believed you need a new phone anytime you want to change your number.  **Why is this person responsible for directing technological legislation?**

## If the U.S was being created today, the Founding Fathers would have put encryption in the Bill of Rights along with the 4th amendment.

I really wanted to avoid politics on this blog, but when it inevitably becomes intertwined with information security and tech, individuals in my field have a responsibility to advocate for secure practices. 

Let's reiterate that we have a constitutional right to assembly and privacy. We come together online to talk and discuss. We have a right (and reasonable expectation) for those digital assemblies to be private.
I'd argue that banning encryption is a violation of the Constitution. The government forcing you to change your speech to make it more favorable to the government is unconstitutional. 


### C'mon South Carolina.
It's cool if you're like, 100 years old and retired, or your field of work doesnt call on you to stay up to date on the most modern elements and practices within our society. It's really no ones business to get involved in those decisions and I'd 100% understand if you want to opt out.

It's another thing entirely when you're a United States Senator, responsible for decisions that affect millions of people. 

Lindsey Graham's level of ignorance on modern technology is both negligent and extremely irresponsible. I was talking to a South Carolina native who mentioned that senators in their state are held in a high regard as expected, but to my surprise their positions are generally believed to be set in stone upon election. This bill and those advocating for it may have pure intentions, but the detriment to internet privacy accompanying it is being overlooked and seemingly disregarded.
