My last post on this blog was around the time Covid really began taking its toll globally, and I encouraged my readers at the time to consider investing a part of their portfolio into bitcoin. On the day I published that post, bitcoin was trading at $8900, and it has not gone below that price since. BTC traded at $12k within 3 months, $18k within 6 months, $40k within 8 months, and peaked at approximately $63k inside a year. This week it hit an ATH of $66k.

Without doubt, BTC has had its share of volatility and anyone who doesn't have the capacity to handle the disgusting downswings should avoid trading it. I still think BTC has room to grow, but I'm also including a portion of my portfolio towards ETH. 

A stock market crash is inevitable at this point, so I'm refraining from becoming too invested in any particular stock. Set and forget in **VOO or **VTI**, and long semiconductor ETFs (**TSM/SOXX & INTC**). If you're a highroller you can take a chance on cannabis which has taken a hit and may have upward movement with Dems trying to move legislation forward. Also consider mining ops like **GDX** and green energy.

Obligatory I'm not a financial advisor and do your own DD.
