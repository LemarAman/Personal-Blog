## I'm Lemar Aman,

LA native, security analyst, and software developer.

I've worked as a security consultant for the majority of my professional career, advising companies like [AIG](https://www.aigusa.com/){:target="blank"} on improving security protocol. Now I'm focusing my efforts on improving InfoSec for the average human.

I prefer listening to talking, reading to socializing, and cozy chats to group settings.  Want to chat? Feel free to [email me](mailto:lemaraman@protonmail.com), or open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/amanlemar){:target="blank"} if you have a question other people might be interested in.
