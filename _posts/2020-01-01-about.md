## I'm Lemar Aman,

LA native and software developer.

I've worked as a private security consultant for the majority of my professional career, advising companies like [AIG](https://www.aigusa.com/){:target="blank"} on improving security protocol. My focus is on helping people and businesses protect themselves as they navigate through the digital realm.
